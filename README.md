# dota-dragon-chess-fun

Simple scripts for fun, trying to play Dota's Dragon Chess mode (game mechanics similar to Candy Crush like puzzle games).
Fully external, taking screenshots and aprsing them. No hooks, no game memory access, nothing.
Note: This game mode is meant for fun and there is no PvP element. So, even if this script was successful, it shouldn't ruin the game or fun.
